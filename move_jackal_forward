# 1. --- TERMINAL 1 : SSH ---
ssh administrator@192.168.1.1

# 2. !!! start the Jackal ROS
roslaunch jackal_base base.launch

# --- TERMINAL 2: ---
ssh administrator@192.168.1.1

# 3. Find your script
cd ~

# 4. Ensure the script is executable:
chmod +x move_jackal_forward.sh

# 5. Source the ROS environment:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

# 6. Run the forward-motion script:
./move_jackal_forward.sh    # publishes a Twist to /cmd_vel at 10 Hz for 1 s (forward at 0.5 m/s), then stops :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

# 7) In any terminal, monitor the cmd_vel topic to verify
rostopic echo /cmd_vel

# 1) Drive forward at 0.5 m/s for 0.5 seconds

# rostopic pub – launches a one-off or continuous publisher to a ROS topic
# -r 10 – publish at 10 Hz
# -d 0.5 – keep publishing for 0.5 seconds
# /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist – the topic and message type: Jackal’s kinematic controller subscribes to /cmd_vel for velocity commands
